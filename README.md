# Forecourt Simulation App

An app to simulate the behaviour of a forecourt with 9 fuel pumps.

Comments are provided to explain its working


## TODO
To add to the realism of the simulation and to account for driversâ€™ agitation, should a vehicle not be fuelled randomly between one and two seconds, it will leave the forecourt.
